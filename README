will use cool Markdown editor to write up a summary of what this is. 
In short just a personal website based of a template, using as many free resources as possible to minimize cost and hosting.
Did buy a domain name but it was $12 and hosting should be free with student accounts and credits. Will try to manage and host a email server next to have a cool custom email.
